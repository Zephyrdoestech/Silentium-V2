# STORY

## Worlds
### Ruined Town of Echoes
The Ruined Town stands as a skeleton of what once was: cracked walls, caved roofs, and empty window holes. Dust thickly settles on streets where no footsteps fall, and weeds grow between stones, reclaiming abandoned homes. Every corner suggests a story cut short—lives forgotten, stillness holding them in place. Time lingers here, unmoving and waiting for something to stir it again.

### Silent Caverns
Beneath the shattered town lie caverns swallowed by darkness, where silence is absolute and every sound is hunted. Monsters born from broken echoes feed on stray notes. The hero presses forward, wielding instruments as weapons. Each melody is a strike against the creeping stillness, a prelude to the confrontation with the force that seeks to erase sound.

### Abyss of Dissonance
At the edge of the world lies the Abyss, where silence is a hungry, living force. A sovereign who loathes sound dwells here, devouring every whisper and song. The air is crushing, as if breath itself is forbidden. In the Abyss the hero must unleash full-force melodies to carve through the void toward the final symphony.

## Plot

### History
Once, the town echoed with song—streets alive with instruments and the daily joy of music. The people believed a great guardian watched over them; in devotion they offered harmonies. One day the guardian requested rest: "I shall not be woken from my slumber." The people obeyed, lowering their voices and setting aside instruments. Believing peace came from the guardian, they did not realize music itself kept darker forces at bay.

Silence gave birth to Shadow Beasts, creatures that fed on stillness. When the beasts emerged, panic struck. Sound became doom—Shadows despised it—so survivors clung to silence. Centuries of absolute quiet drained the life from the living until the world became a hollow echo of what it once was.

### Main Event
A single bell broke that silence. Its tone spread like wildfire, shaking the world. Shadow Beasts awoke and rushed to the surface, searching for the sound's source. A few children, born in silence, were drawn to the bell's strange vibration. It stirred something in them: a call to uncover why silence was broken and why the beasts had awakened.

### Progression
- Start: Ruined Town of Echoes — the bell shatters stillness. The child learns vibration and uses an instrument to repel Shadows, discovering a stairway under the ruins.
- Middle: Silent Caverns — silence here is a predator. The child refines musical techniques: bursts to clear paths, resonances to reveal secrets, and strikes to collapse enemies, leading to a chasm that opens to the Abyss.
- End: Abyss of Dissonance — vibrations are swallowed instantly. Paths twist, Shadows grow stronger, and each note is an act of defiance pushing toward the source of silence.

### Climax
In the Abyss, the child faces the ancient presence that devoured all sound. The journey's weight—ruins, shadows, and empty childhood—presses in. The child plays to fight and to answer a deeper yearning: to feel what it means to listen. Each note is defiance, grief, hope, and love, carrying the weight of those silenced before.
